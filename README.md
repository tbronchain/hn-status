# hn-status
See the current home page status of a post on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com)

This is especially useful if you are publishing a post, and would like to track its current ranking,
without constantly searching for it.

## Installation
You can install the Chrome extention, by downloading it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hn-status/edmbgdfejjdikhaniepceopkchejaghp).

## Usage
Access a post page, for example by clicking on the comment(s) number (or "discuss") link, under a post name, from [HN homepage](http://news.ycombinator.com)

![access post page](screenshots/access_post_page.png)

(date, or direct link work as well).

When on a Hacker News post page (e.g. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10014045),
a new "show status" link will be added.

![show status](screenshots/show_status.png)

Click on this link in order to display the current article's position

![show position](screenshots/show_position.png)

If the post is no longer on HN homepage, "absent" will be displayed

![show absent](screenshots/show_absent.png)

To update the current position, simply reclick on the "home position" link.

That's All Folks!
